# üöÄ ZenCode - Intelligent DSA Revision Platform

A modern, full-stack web application designed to **revolutionize how you revise Data Structures & Algorithms**. Unlike traditional problem trackers, ScaleCode uses an **intelligent spaced-repetition algorithm** to ensure you never forget what you've learned.

**üåê Live Demo:** [https://scale-code.vercel.app/](https://scale-code.vercel.app/)

## üéØ The Problem We Solve

You solve hundreds of DSA problems, but **retention is the real challenge**. Most developers forget solutions within weeks. ScaleCode ensures **lasting mastery** through:

‚úÖ **Automatic confidence decay** - Your confidence drops 10% every 2 weeks without revision  
‚úÖ **Smart priority scoring** - AI-driven algorithm determines which problems need attention  
‚úÖ **Spaced repetition** - Review problems at optimal intervals for long-term retention  
‚úÖ **Save & Organize** - Store every DSA problem you solve with your code, approach, and intuition  

## üß† Smart Revision System - The Core Feature

### How It Works

1. **Save Your Solutions**: Add problems with your code, approach, and initial confidence level (1-10)
2. **Confidence Decay**: Your confidence automatically decays 10% every 2 weeks (capped at 50% max decay)
3. **Priority Algorithm**: Problems are ranked using:
   ```
   Priority Score = (Adjusted Confidence √ó 0.7) - (Time Factor √ó 0.3)
   Lower Score = Higher Priority
   ```
4. **Smart Revision**: Get notified which problems need urgent revision vs. which can wait

### Confidence-Based Learning

Replace arbitrary "difficulty ratings" with **personal confidence tracking**:
- **1-3 (Red)**: Very Low - Urgent revision needed
- **4-6 (Orange)**: Medium - High priority for revision  
- **7-8 (Light Green)**: Good - Medium priority
- **9-10 (Dark Green)**: Excellent - Low priority

Your confidence decays over time, ensuring you revisit problems before forgetting them completely.

### Revision Modes

- **Priority Mode**: Focus on problems with lowest priority scores
- **Urgent Mode**: Only problems with confidence < 4 (red zone)
- **Needs Revision**: Problems with decayed confidence
- **All Problems**: Complete overview with filtering and sorting

## üé® Features in Detail

### Intelligent Revision Algorithm
The core of ScaleCode is its **spaced-repetition algorithm**:

#### Confidence Decay
```
Decay Rate: 10% every 2 weeks (14 days)
Maximum Decay: 50% (your confidence won't drop below half)
Minimum Confidence: 1 (floor value)
```

**Example:**
- Day 0: You solve a problem with confidence 8
- Day 14: Confidence decays to 7.2 (8 √ó 0.9)
- Day 28: Confidence decays to 6.4 (8 √ó 0.8)
- Day 70: Confidence capped at 4.0 (8 √ó 0.5, max 50% decay)

#### Priority Scoring
Problems are ranked using a weighted formula:
```
Priority Score = (Adjusted Confidence √ó 0.7) - (Time Factor √ó 0.3)

Where:
- Adjusted Confidence = Original Confidence √ó (1 - Decay)
- Time Factor = (Days Since Revision / 30) √ó 10
- Lower Score = Higher Priority (appears first)
```

This ensures:
- ‚úÖ Low confidence problems get priority
- ‚úÖ Old problems don't get forgotten
- ‚úÖ Optimal spacing for long-term retention

### Problem Categories
Based on **Striver's A2Z DSA Course**, including:
- **Fundamentals**: Basic Maths, Recursion, Hashing
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Heaps, Graphs
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, Searching, Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Binary Search
- **Advanced Topics**: Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, Backtracking
- **Specialized**: Bit Manipulation, Tries, Segment Trees, System Design

### Why Confidence Over Difficulty?
Traditional platforms rate problem difficulty as a static value. ScaleCode is **personal**:
- **Subjective Understanding**: What's hard for others might be easy for you
- **Dynamic Learning**: Your confidence changes as you learn
- **Decay Tracking**: Ensures you don't fool yourself into thinking you remember something you don't
- **Personalized Revision**: Focus on YOUR weak areas, not arbitrary difficulty ratings

### Responsive Design
- **Mobile-First**: Optimized for phones and tablets
- **Desktop Enhanced**: Rich experience on larger screens
- **Touch-Friendly**: Easy navigation on all devices
- **Fast Loading**: Optimized performance across devices

## üöÄ Deployment

The application is optimized for **Vercel** deployment with automatic CI/CD:

1. **Push to GitHub**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin main
```

2. **Connect to Vercel**
   - Import your repository on Vercel
   - Add environment variables
   - Deploy automatically on every push

3. **Environment Variables**
Set production values for:
   - `MONGODB_URI` - Your MongoDB Atlas connection string
   - `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` - Clerk secret key
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Clerk publishable key
   - Clerk webhook secret for user synchronization
